WASHINGTON – Mitt Romney filed his 2011 tax returns today -- capping a difficult week by returning to the campaign a topic that has dogged the candidacy of the Republican presidential nominee – and is also releasing a 20-year snapshot of his tax returns.

Romney’s updated tax returns, which will be posted online in full at 3 p.m. on Friday, show that he paid $1.9 million in taxes on $13.7 million in income, most of which came from his investments. It means his effective tax rate for 2011 was 14.1 percent, which is slightly higher than it was in 2010 but still far lower than the rate most Americans pay.

The Romneys donated $4 million to charity, according to a summary of the returns released early by his campaign. Romney claimed a deduction of $2.25 million from those charitable contributions. He claimed less than he otherwise could have, his campaign said, so that he could still abide by a pledge made in August that he paid at least 13 percent in income taxes in each of the last 10 years.

Perhaps more significantly, Romney this afternoon is also releasing a summary of his tax returns over a 20-year period, covering the years from 1990 to 2009. That summary, which was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that in each of the last 20 years he owed both federal and state income taxes.

Over that period, the summary says, the average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.2 percent. The lowest annual effective federal tax rate he paid was 13.7 percent. The Romney’s also donated an average of 13.45 percent to charity over that 20 year period.

Romney is still not releasing the actual tax forms from that period, however, meaning he will have released two years worth of tax returns total.
